  <string name="help_intro">When you launch <i>&app_name;</i> through its app icon, you manage a list of
    FTP(s) URIs.\n
    - <b>Add</b> : Simply enter an URI (ftp or ftps) into the text field at the bottom of the screen.\n
    The following actions can be called upon each URI through its context menu:\n
    - <b>Edit</b> : The text field at the bottom gets filled, and you can edit the URI, and commit your change through the <b>Change</b> button.\n
    - <b>Delete</b> : The entry will be removed from the list.\n
    - <b>Pick a file for upload</b> : You need to install <i>OI File Manager</i>. You can select a file that will be
      uploaded to the target URI.\n
    \nIt is from this list that you can select a target URI when you choose <i>&app_name;</i>
    for sharing content. Before selecting a target (by clicking on its entry in the list), you can still add, edit, delete entries,
    as explained above.
