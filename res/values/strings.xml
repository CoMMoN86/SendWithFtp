  <string name="help_intro">&app_name; responds to two intents for sharing files through FTP:
\n1) android.intent.action.SEND: The user manages a list of FTP URIs and selects one as the target 
for the file being shared. This intent is Android\'s generic standard for sharing files, thus 
&app_name; will be available from any app allowing to share files.
\n2) android.intent.action.SENDTO: if the URI in the data is of scheme ftp: &app_name; immediately 
triggers the upload to this target.</string>
