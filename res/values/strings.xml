  <string name="help_intro">When you launch Send With FTP through its app icon, you manage a list of
		FTP URIs. You can:\n
		\n - <b>Add a URI</b> : Simply enter it into the text field at the bottom of the screen and click on <b>Add</b>
		\n - <b>Edit a URI</b> : Select <b>Edit</b> from an entry\'s context menu. The text field at the bottom gets filled with 
		its content, and you can edit it, and commit your change through the <b>Change</b> button.
		\n - <b>Delete a URI</b> : Select <b>Delete</b> from an entry\'s context menu.\n
		\nIt is from this list that you can select a target URI when you choose Send With FTP
		for sharing content. Before selecting a target (by clicking on its entry in the list), you can still add, edit, delete entries,
		as explained above.
