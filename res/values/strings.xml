  <string name="help_intro"><i>&app_name;</i> responds to two intents for sharing files through FTP:
\n1) android.intent.action.SEND: The user manages a list of FTP URIs and selects one as the target 
for the file being shared. This intent is Android\'s generic standard for sharing files, thus 
<i>&app_name;</i> will be available from any app allowing to share files.
\n2) android.intent.action.SENDTO: if the URI in the data is of scheme ftp, <i>&app_name;</i> immediately 
triggers the upload to this target. This mode is used from my app <i>My Expenses</i>.\n
<i>&app_name;</i> currently does not prompt for username and password. You have to provide them in the URI,
e.g.: ftp://login:password@my.example.org:port/my/directory/ .
